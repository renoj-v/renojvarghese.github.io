Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences. </p><div class="quote-box"><!-- h5.quote-question| What do you wish could be improved in the process of finding your representatives' contact information?--><blockquote class="quote">It would be nice to have all my representatives' information in one place on my phone, kind of like having my Senator's phone number in my Contacts</blockquote><p class="quote-source">– Emily</p></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Interviews with Government Offices</h3><p class="project-p">To tackle the problem from another angle, I contacted my own reps.

Sources included The Annenberg Public Policy Center, Pew Research Center, Congress Management Foundation, The Boston Globe, and GlobalCitizen.org.

A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/competitive-analysis.png"></div><h4 class="mb-xxl mt-xl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-xl"><p>One useful feature in the Open States and Capitol Call app was to be able to see current bills on the docket.

At each stage, I incorporated feedback from users and mentors. Here's a brief overview of some the stages. 
Testing consisted of citizens using a prototype in an interview format and answering followup questions to understand their experience.
Mentors provided more formal critique.</p><div class="grid-3 flex"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/wireframes.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item right pl-xxxl"><h5>Representative Cards</h5><p class="caption">Cycle through individual cards to meet reps and learn how to contact them.</p><h5>Rationale</h5><p class="caption">Based on the research, the main problem to solve was consoldiating representatives’ contact info in one place.

The goal was to help citizens know what they’re represenatives are up to as well encourage them to engage with petitions and bills. The messaging system can be acceessed from representative profiles, the political feed, and the main navigation to encourage citizens to contact their representatives through GovConctact</p><h5>Feedback</h5><p class="caption">Engagements from social media, petitions, and bills could be sent to representatives as a summary report to be used to understand citizens’ opinions. </p></div></div><!--.grid-3.flex.grid-3-item.left

        Trying to gauge the amount of info a citizen need about a rep. 
        Users needed more information about a rep's political stance than party affiliation.
        Also started with a layer of a classic "red, white, and blue" visual design.

        After testing the second prototype and receiving feedback from mentors, I learned that the information was too tightly packed. 
        For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.

    p.project-p.
        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.
