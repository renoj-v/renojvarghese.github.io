However, contacting your legislator is one of the simplest and effective ways to use your political voice. UX design has a role in political activism by designing how we can communicate with government officials.</h2><h3>Overview</h3><h4>Role</h4><p class="mb-l">Product Designer, UX Researcher</p><h4>Team</h4><p class="mb-l">Solo, with help from mentors and professors</p><h4>Duration</h4><p>10 weeks</p></div><div class="solution-block project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>solution</h6><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-1.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Help reps introduce themselves and where they stand on issues</h3><p class="project-p">One of the challenges of contacting your representatives is know who they are and what they care about. Representatives can create profiles on GovContact to communicate their political stances.</p></div><div class="solution grid grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><h3>Allow citizens to message reps in any format</h3><p class="project-p">There are many ways to message a representative. An easy way is directly through GovContact. Citizens can write messages or share video recording with their representatives.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-2.png"></div></div></div><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-3.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">A political feed that helps citizens remain informed and take action for petitions and bills</h3><p class="project-p">We can utilize primary source information, such as social media posts from representatives, petitions, and bills to help citizens to take little actions. Even making little engagements can make huge impact.</p></div></div></div><div class="project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>research</h6><h3>Focus Group</h3><!--h5| Objective:
| Understand the steps people would currently take to contact a representative--><p class="project-p">To hit the ground running, I arranged a focus group to receive a large amount of qualitative insights in a short amount of time.
Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences. </p><div class="quote-box"><h4 class="quote-question">What do you wish could be improved in the process of finding your representatives' contact information?</h4><blockquote class="quote">It would be nice to have all my representatives' information in one place on my phone, kind of like having my Senator's phone number in my Contacts</blockquote><h4 class="quote-source">– Emily</h4></div><div class="quote-box"><blockquote class="quote">Researching my representatives online is fine for contacting them once. If I had to regularly contact them, I think I would need an app.</blockquote><h4 class="quote-source">– Tori</h4></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Competitive Analysis</h3><!--h5| Objective:
| Analyze what is successful and what could be improved in existing civic engagement apps--><p class="project-p">There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/competitive-analysis.png"></div><h4 class="mb-xxl mt-xl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-xl"><h5>One feature in the Open States and Capitol Call app was to be able to see current bills on the docket. Knowing the bills a representative has written says a lot about what the representative supports.</h5></li><li><h5>The apps that required the greatest number of intermediate interactions had a long sign-up process, surveys, or account verifications.</h5></li></ul></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Government Office Interviews</h3><!--h5| Objective:
| Understand the perspective of represenatatives and employees receiving citizens' messages--><p class="project-p">To tackle the problem from all angles, I contacted my own reps. I called their offices and conducted surveys on how a citizen could best get their voice heard.
It was helpful to understand what happens to a citizen's message.</p><h4 class="mb-xxl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-xl"><h5>Employees in representatives' offices respond to citizens' messages rather than representatives themselves</h5></li><li class="mb-xl"> <h5>A citizen's message would be passed on to a representative or included as part of a summary report</h5></li><li> <h5>The best way for a citizen's voice to be heard is frequent, clear, and concise messages</h5></li></ul></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Online Research</h3><!--h5| Objective:
| Figure out the larger scope of the problem and adapt existing research
--><p class="project-p">To understand civic engagement on a broader scale, I looked online for previous research. A few studies, surveys, and articles revealed some new insights as well as why this problem was worth solving.
