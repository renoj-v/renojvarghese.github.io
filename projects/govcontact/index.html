        Users needed more information about a rep's political stance than party affiliation.
        Also started with a layer of a classic "red, white, and blue" visual design.

        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.

Talking to real people helped me develop a greater sense of empathy of what people needed in a civic engagment app.</li><li><h5>Consider Visual Design Early On</h5>To develop a richer visual language, I started the process early.
