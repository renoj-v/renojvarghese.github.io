The goal of GovContact is to put that power at a citizen's fingertips. UX design has a role in political activism by designing how we can communicate with government officials.</h2><h3>Overview</h3><h4>Role</h4><p class="mb-l">Product Designer, UX Researcher</p><h4>Team</h4><p class="mb-l">Solo, with help from mentors and professors</p><h4>Duration</h4><p>10 weeks</p></div><div class="solution-block project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>solution</h6><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-1.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Help reps introduce themselves and where they stand on issues</h3><p class="project-p">One of the challenges of contacting your representatives is know who they are and what they care about. Representatives can create profiles on GovContact to communicate their political stances.</p></div><div class="solution grid grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item left"><h3>Allow citizens to message reps in any format</h3><p class="project-p">There are many ways to message a representative. An easy way is directly through GovContact. Citizens can write messages or share video recording with their representatives.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-2.png"></div></div></div><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/sol-3.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">A political feed that helps citizens remain informed and take action for petitions and bills</h3><p class="project-p">We can utilize primary source information, such as social media posts from representatives, petitions, and bills to help citizens to take little actions. Even making little engagements can make huge impact.</p></div></div></div><div class="project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>research</h6><h3>Focus Group</h3><p class="project-p">To hit the ground running, I arranged a focus group to receive a large amount of qualitative insights in a short amount of time.
Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences. </p><div class="quote-box"><h4 class="quote-question">What do you wish could be improved in the process of finding your representatives' contact information?</h4><blockquote class="quote">It would be nice to have all my representatives' information in one place on my phone, kind of like having my Senator's phone number in my Contacts</blockquote><h4 class="quote-source">– Emily</h4></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Competitive Analysis</h3><p class="project-p">There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/competitive-analysis.png"></div><h4 class="mb-xxl mt-xl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-xl"><p>One useful feature in the Open States and Capitol Call app was to be able to see current bills on the docket. Knowing the bills a representative has written says a lot about what the representative supports.</p></li><li><p>The apps that required the greatest number of intermediate interactions had a long sign-up process, surveys, or account verifications.</p></li></ul></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Government Office Interviews</h3><p class="project-p">To tackle the problem from all angles, I contacted my own reps. I called their offices and conducted surveys on how a citizen could best get their voice heard.
It was helpful to understand what happens to a citizen's message.</p><h4 class="mb-xl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-l"><p>Employees in representatives' offices respond to citizens' messages rather than representatives themselves</p></li><li class="mb-l"> <p>A citizen's message would be passed on to a representative or included as part of a summary report</p></li><li> <p>The best way for a citizen's voice to be heard is frequent, clear, and concise messages</p></li></ul></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Online Research</h3><p class="project-p">To understand civic engagement on a broader scale, I looked online for previous research. A few studies, surveys, and articles revealed some new insights as well as why this problem was worth solving. 
Sources included The Annenberg Public Policy Center, Pew Research Center, Congress Management Foundation, The Boston Globe, and GlobalCitizen.org.

At each stage, I incorporated feedback from users and mentors. Let's go through the evolution together.</p><div class="grid-3 flex"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/wireframe.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xxxl"><h4>Concepting and Wireframing</h4><p class="project-p">The initial step was to come with different ways of showcasing a representative. For the first prototype, experiments focused on what type of contact information would be important. I chose a card style interface at first to allow users to quickly scan multiple reps </p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/first-prototype.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xxxl"><h4>First Prototype</h4><p class="project-p">Building upon wireframes, I added a layer of visual design that focused on the red, white, and blue that appears in many political campaigns.
After conducting user tests, I found that citizens needed more information about a representative than just their party affiliation and contact information.</p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/second-prototype.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xxxl"><h4>Second Prototype</h4><p class="project-p">Incorporating the insights from user testing, I went towards a profile feature that representatives could fill out to connect with citizens.
This information could also be scraped from their social media or bills that they have written. This information would be more helpful in understanding a representative than their political party affiliation.</p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-rep.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xxxl"><h4>Current Solution</h4><p class="project-p">After testing the second prototype and receiving feedback from mentors, I learned that the information was too tightly packed. 
For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.</p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-xl"><div class="grid-3-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/final-feed.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xxxl"><h4>Current Solution Pt.2</h4><p class="project-p">One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Visual Design Elements</h3><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/visual-design.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>User Flows from Personas</h3><p class="project-p">To consider how well my solution would work, I considered the paths that Terry and Briana would take to accomplish their goals.
Both need to learn where their representatives stand on the issues. Terry could directly message his state representatives voting on the free tuition bill. 
Briana could stay updated with her representatives, message representatives immediately, and share GovContact with her advocacy group.</p><!--+img("briana-terry-flow.png")--><div class="mt-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/onboarding-flow.png"></div></div><div class="mt-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/learning-flow.png"></div></div><div class="mt-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/terry-message.png"></div></div><div class="mt-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/briana-message.png"></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>conclusion</h6><h3>Results</h3><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/results.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
