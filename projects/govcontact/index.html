Participants were asked to imagine a scenario in which they were looking to contact a representative about education reform. Then participants indivdually went to go find that information. 
Afterwards, there was a group discussion about their experiences. </p><div class="quote-box"><!-- h5.quote-question| What do you wish could be improved in the process of finding your representatives' contact information?--><blockquote class="quote">It would be nice to have all my representatives' information in one place on my phone, kind of like having my Senator's phone number in my Contacts</blockquote><p class="quote-source">– Emily</p></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Competitive Analysis</h3><p class="project-p">There are other organizations trying to accomplish the same goal. Some analysis showed what could be improved in civic engagement apps.
A few factors include the number of interactions (clicks, scroll) to get to contact info, the levels of representatives (federal, state, and local) shown, and evaluation of features.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/govcontact/competitive-analysis.png"></div><h4 class="mb-xxl mt-xl">Takeaways</h4><ul><li class="mb-xl"><p>One useful feature in the Open States and Capitol Call app was to be able to see current bills on the docket.

        After testing the second prototype and receiving feedback from mentors, I learned that the information was too tightly packed. 
        For the final set of information, I gave information more room to breathe and further developed the visual design.

    h4 Current Solution Pt.2
    p.project-p.
        One of the features after the second prototype was a Political Feed feature, where citizens could keep up with representatives' social media, petitions being called upon, and bills up for vote.
        This information would come directly from representatives, government sites, and petition websites, like Change.org. It relies less on news outlets that may have bias. Citizens are given the primary source.
