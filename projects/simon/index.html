How might we inform busy adults, those who may forget to check the forecast, be prepared for the weather?--><!-- h2 The weather forecast determines how we plan our day. The goal of this project is to reimagine how we receive the forecast.To do what? how we can be better prepared for the weather--><h2>Even simple problems can have creative solutions. Simon Says the Weather aims to take a new perspective on mobile weather apps.</h2><div class="goals grid-2 flex mt-xxl"><div class="grid-2-item left"><p class="bold">Goal 1</p><p class="project-p">Explore how we can make the weather both fun and informative.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><p class="bold">Goal 2</p><p class="project-p">Provide the forecast to those who don't check the weather.</p></div></div><!--p.project-p.The weather can be quite unpredictable, especially where I live in the Northeast. If we're not prepared, then our whole day can be thrown off. The goal of this app to make sure busy adults, those who may not always be thinking about the weather, are informed and ready to act.--><h3>Overview<h4>Role</h4><p class="mb-l">Product Designer, UX Researcher</p><h4>Team</h4><p class="mb-l">Solo, with help from mentors and professors</p><h4>Duration</h4><p>6 weeks</p></h3></div><div class="tint-box project-container"><div class="content-container"><div class="solution grid grid-2 flex project-container"><div class="grid-2-item left"><h6>solution</h6><h3>Meet Simon, a personal assistant to help you with the weather</h3><p>Similar to voice assistants, like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, Simon is a user's personal weatherman. He works as hard as the busy people he informs about the weather.</p></div><div class="grid-2-item right"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/sol-1.png"></div></div></div><div class="solution project-container"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/sol-2.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Widgets prepare you for the weather outside the app</h3><p class="project-p">Instead of bringing people to the forecast, let's bring the forecast to the people. Widgets allow Simon to report the weather on the platforms busy adults use.</p></div><div class="solution grid-3 project-container"><div class="grid-3-2-item"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/sol-3.png"></div></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Notifications to report the weather when you need it</h3><p class="project-p">Research showed that people check the weather the most during the morning. Notifications can report the weather in the morning while also alerting busy adults to weather changes throughout the day.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><h6>research</h6><h3>User Interviews and Analysis</h3><p class="project-p">Before designing, I needed to understand how people currently learn about the weather. My first step in the process was to talk to my potential users: busy adults. I conducted interviews with individuals in my area to understand how often they check the weather and how it affects their day.</p><div class="quote-box mb-xxl"><blockquote class="quote">One thing my weather app doesn’t do is greet me … something like ‘Hey Carrie! It’s going to be a sunny day. Remember to wear sunscreen.’</blockquote><h4 class="quote-source">– Carrie</h4></div><div class="quote-box mb-xxl"><blockquote class="quote">I check my Outlook calendar first thing in the morning. I’d be more informed about the weather if the forecast showed up there</blockquote><h4 class="quote-source">– Matt</h4></div><h3 class="mt-separate">Competitive Analysis</h3><p class="project-p">Some of the users I interviewed already used a weather app. I investigated their applications and those similar to understand their experiences</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/competitive-analysis.png"></div></div><div class="tint-box"><div class="insights-opportunities content-container project-container"><h3 class="i-o-header">Key Insights and Opportunities</h3><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Interviews showed that usy adults already use many digital applications for work and play </h4><p class="opportunity">One opportunity is to connect the forecast to these existing apps, such as Outlook</p></div><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Interviews showed that users spend a lot of time thinking about how to dress for the weather</h4><p class="opportunity">Recommending how to prepare for the weather would help users plan their day</p></div><div class="i-o mb-0"><h4 class="insight">Competitive Analysis showed weather apps vary in features and in how they visualize the forecast</h4><p class="opportunity">An opportunity to think of a new way to report the weather and adapt existing heuristics </p></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><h3>Personas</h3><p class="project-p">Personas summarized my research efforts and helped me take a user-centered design approach. When considering ideas and concepts, I considered what Jennifer and David would need in a weather app</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/personas.png"></div><h6 class="mt-separate">design</h6><h3>Wireframe Prototypes</h3><p class="project-p">After research, I went directly to wireframes and prototyping ideas to test with my users. The goal was to get out different concepts and gauge user reactions and feedback. One set of user tests was conducted in an interiew format, where participants were able to engage with all three concepts.</p><div class="grid-3 flex mt-xxl"><div class="grid-3-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/wire-1.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xl"><h5>Concept 1: Traditional weather app</h5><p class="caption">Based on the apps analyzed in the competitive analysis. Users can see the weather for the week and get an hour-by-hour forecast by tapping on a day.</p><h5>Rationale</h5><p class="caption">As a control, this version of the weather app helped participants compare their experience with a traditional weather app with the more experimental concepts</p><h5>Feedback</h5><p class="caption">Users understood how to navigate the app, but there wasn't anything unique compared to other weather apps</p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-3-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/wire-2.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xl"><h5>Concept 2: Widget Plugins</h5><p class="caption">Control panel that lets users control Widgets, weather plugins that can connect to other apps</p><h5>Rationale</h5><p class="caption">My goal was to provide the forecast in apps people already use. Users could set up their Widgets once and then never have to worry about opening up a weather app again</p><h5>Feedback</h5><p class="caption">Participants were able to understand what Widgets were and how they might affect other apps. The concept added value, but users would still want a dedicated place to check the weather on their phone.</p></div></div><div class="grid-3 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-3-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/wire-3.png"></div></div><div class="grid-3-2-item pl-xl"><h5>Concept 3: AI Assistant</h5><p class="caption">An assistant that could message users and send notifications directly to their phone. Users could also ask for suggestions about how to prepare for the day.</p><h5>Rationale</h5><p class="caption">Inspired by voice assistants, I wanted to provide a more personalized way to interact with the forecast. A personal weatherman has a sense of trustiworthiness and expertise that people can rely on. </p><h5>Feedback</h5><p class="caption">Participants liked the idea of having a personal weatherman, but were unlikely to interact within a chat</p></div></div></div><div class="tint-box project-extra-padding"><div class="project-container content-container"><h3>Main Conclusion: Each of the three concepts had something valuable, and the final solution would be their combination</h3></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><h3>Wireflow to Integrate Widgets Concept</h3><p class="project-p">Widgets were a strong concept that participants enjoyed. To tie them into a traditional mobile weather app, I created different user flows to see how they might fit in. Here’s the final user flow I landed on</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/user-flow.png"> </div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Giving Character to an AI Assistant</h3><p class="project-p">Participants enjoyed the concept of having a personal weather reporter. I adapted the idea to a central character of the weather app: Simon the Weather Man. 
Although I only started with one character, a future feature would be to allow users to choose one of many weather reporters, each reflecting different races, genders, and body types.</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/character-design.png"></div></div><!--.content-container.project-containerh3 Character and Visual Design

In contrast to more informational approach, Simon Says the Weather takes a more playful approach to reporting to the weather.</li><li> <h5>Widget Plugins</h5>Designed Widgets feature to allow people to receive the forecast in the applications they already use. The purpose is to make sure people are prepared for the weather, even if they don't have the time to check the weather.</li></ul><h3 class="mt-separate">Challenges and Lessons</h3><ul><li class="mb-l"><h5>Illustrations and Incorporating Them into a UI</h5>There was a strong contention between how many illustrations to add versus how much of the UI would be dedicated to user interface. Illustrations helped provide the mood of the weather, while the UI included more specific numbers and information about the weather. It required a balance between being playful yet informative. </li></ul><h3 class="mt-separate">Next Steps</h3><ul><li class="mb-l"><h5>Inclusive Design</h5>If I had more time on this project, I would want to design more weather reporters who would reflect different races, gender expressions, and body types. The goal would be for users to be able to select the weatherman that reflects them best.</li></ul><h3 class="mb-xxl mt-separate">Final Screens</h3><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/simon/results.png"></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container project-extra-padding"><a href="../../"><h3 class="mb-s small-caps">go back to home</h3></a></div></div></div><footer class="footer"></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="../../main.js"></script></body></html>
