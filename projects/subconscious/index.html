They host a web platform where people can share their stories. The goal is help others with mental illnesses and build empathy with those who do not</h2><h2>My mission was redesigning the initial experience readers have with Subconscious's web platform. The first touch is the most important to help the reader understand who the organization is and if they want to come back.</h2><h3>Overview<h4>Roles</h4><p class="mb-l">UX Researcher, UX Designer</p><h4>Team</h4><p class="mb-l">The Subconscious Team: Cathy Liu, Allison Chang, Robin Kuang, and Jennifer Chiang</p><h4>Duration</h4><p>10 weeks</p></h3></div><div class="solution-block project-container"><div class="content-container"><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sol-1.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Stories are the stars of the website</h3><p class="project-p">Make it easier to search and filter articles based on terms people would search for. </p></div><div class="solution"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sol-2.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Talk about how and why Subconscious started</h3><p class="project-p">Let's increase transparency and introduce the organization by telling where it started and why its founders pursued this mission of storytelling. </p></div><div class="solution grid-3"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sol-3.png"></div><h3 class="mt-xl">Donations support the mission</h3><p class="project-p">Be clear where donation funds go so that readers can understand why they should support Subconscious. </p></div></div></div><div class="tint-box project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container"><h3>Research on UserTesting.com</h3><p class="project-p">The first step in the process was conducting user tests with real people. My main tool was UserTesting.com that provided video and audio recording of people using our site</p></div><div class="insights-opportunities content-container pb-0 pt-0"><h3 class="i-o-header">Key Insights and Opportunities</h3><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Finding a story is challenging without navigation or search tools</h4><p class="opportunity">Maybe we could make mental health stories easier to find</p></div><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">People want to learn more about the Subconscious organization</h4><p class="opportunity">Maybe we could build trust by sharing more information about Subconscious</p></div><div class="i-o mb-0"><h4 class="insight">Readers are hesistant to donate because they are unsure where Donations go</h4><p class="opportunity">Maybe we could redesign how donations are presented to be more transparent</p></div></div></div><div class="project-extra-padding"><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Personas and Journey Maps</h3><p class="project-p">Personas and Journey Maps helped summarize my research results to the Subconscious organization and guide my design work later. With these I was able to have a conversation with organization leaders on how we could better introduce Subconscious to new readers</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/personas-maps.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Frequent Stakeholder Checkins</h3><p class="project -p">A key element in the design and research process was frequently meeting with members of the operations, design, and content. Their feedback helped me understand the aspirations for Subconscious and incorporate the team's ideas in the final redesign</p></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>design</h6><h3>Sketches and Concepts</h3><p class="project-p">The next step was to hit the ground running and think of solutions. The best tool for this was paper and pen</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sketches.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container">  <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3><p class="project-p">Since there was an already established design, I could skip the wireframes and move onto creating a high fidelity prototype. With 2-3 iterations and checking with stakeholders, I was ready to test our new experience</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/mockups.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>A/B Testing</h3><p class="project-p">Again using UserTesting.com, there were two sets of user test focusing on how we could present the Donations page. One prototype contained a Donations page with explicit percentages and another with imagery</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/ab-test.png"></div></div></div><div class="tint-box"><div class="insights-opportunities content-container project-container"><h3 class="i-o-header">Key Insights</h3><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Readers were as likely to donate with version A as with version B</h4><p class="opportunity">There were no significant differences between how readers responded to both versions of the donation page</p></div><div class="i-o"><h4 class="insight">Participants reported they were 40% more likely to donate compared to the original site</h4><p class="opportunity">For both the original site and the redesign participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to donate to Subconscious.
