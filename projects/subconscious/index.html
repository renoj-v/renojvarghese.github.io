The first touch is important to convince the reader the value of mental health storytelling. </h2><div class="goals grid-3 flex mt-xxl"><div class="grid-3-item left"><p class="bold">Goal 1</p><p class="project-p">Simplify finding mental health stories and resources.</p></div><div class="grid-3-item middle"><p class="bold">Goal 2</p><p class="project-p">Introduce the Subconscious organization, its mission, and history.</p></div><div class="grid-3-item right"><p class="bold">Goal 3</p><p class="project-p">Showcase how donations support Subconcious's mission.</p></div></div><h3>Overview</h3><p class="mb-l"><strong>Role: </strong>UX Researcher, UX Designer</p><p class="mb-l"> <strong>Team: </strong>The Subconscious Team: Cathy Liu (Operations), Allison Chang (Operations), Robin Kuang (Design Mentor), and Jennifer Chiang (Content)</p><p class="mb-l"> <strong>Contributions: </strong>User Testing, Personas, Journey Maps, Final Redesigns</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>10 Weeks</p></div><div class="solution-block project-container"><div class="content-container"><div class="solution"><div class="plr-xxxl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sol-1.png"></div></div><h4 class="mt-xl">Stories are the stars of the website</h4><p class="project-p">Make it easier to search and filter articles based on terms people would search for.

With these I was able to have a conversation with organization leaders on how we could better introduce Subconscious to new readers</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/personas-maps.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>Frequent Stakeholder Checkins</h3><p class="project -p">A key element in the design and research process was frequently meeting with members of the operations, design, and content. Their feedback helped me understand the aspirations for Subconscious and incorporate the team's ideas in the final redesign</p></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h6>design</h6><h3>Sketches and Concepts</h3><p class="project-p">The next step was to hit the ground running and think of solutions. The best tool for this was paper and pen</p><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/sketches.png"></div></div><div class="content-container project-container">  <h3>High Fidelity Prototype</h3><p class="project-p">Since there was an already established design system, I could skip the wireframes and move onto creating a high fidelity prototype. With 2-3 iterations and checking with stakeholders, I was ready to test our new experience.</p><!--+img("mockups.png")--><div class="grid-2 flex"><div class="grid-2-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/home-search.png"></div><div class="mt-xl"></div><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/get-help.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item"><h5>Goal 1</h5><p class="caption">Simplify finding mental health stories and resources.</p><h5 class="mb-med">Proposed Solution</h5><ul><li class="mb-m">Include a search feature that could suggest topics to read about.</li><!--li.mb-m Citizens could learn about reps through social media links--></ul><h5 class="mb-m">Rationale</h5><ul><li class="mb-m">4/7 participants failed to find the story they were looking for.</li><li class="mb-m">Provide a search tool that gives readers an idea of what they can find.</li></ul></div><div class="grid-2 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-2-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/our-story copy.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item"><h5>Goal 2</h5><p class="caption">Introduce the Subconscious organization, its mission, and history.</p><h5 class="mb-med">Proposed Solution </h5><ul><li class="mb-m">Redesign the About Us page to include how Subconsious started and its storytelling mission.</li><li class="mb-m">Update Get Help page to provide a reliable source of mental health resources. </li><!--li.mb-m Citizens could learn about reps through social media links--></ul><h5 class="mb-m">Rationale</h5><ul><li class="mb-m">5/7 Participants had repeated questions about why Subconscious started.</li></ul></div></div><div class="grid-2 flex mt-separate"><div class="grid-2-item pr-xl"><div class="img-container"><img src="../../static/img/subconscious/donate-grid copy.png"></div></div><div class="grid-2-item pl-xl"><h5>Goal 3</h5><p class="caption">Showcase how donations support Subconcious's mission.</p><h5 class="mb-med">Proposed</h5><ul><li class="mb-m">In-depth Look at how donations are spent.</li><!--li.mb-m Citizens could learn about reps through social media links--></ul><h5 class="mb-m">Rationale</h5><ul><li class="mb-m">5/7 participants discussed questions about where donation money goes</li><li class="mb-m">This uncertainty made them less likely to donate. </li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="content-container project-container"><h3>A/B Testing</h3><p class="project-p">With the redesign ready, it was time to test.

But to test with users, I needed more realistic copy for readers to get an understanding of who Subconscious is
The Operations and Content teams volunteered to do copywriting, while I could focus on the design.</p><h3 class="mt-separate">Next Steps</h3><h5>Getting the Site Live</h5><p class="project-p">The current redesign is under development.
